   - In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and type "Git: Add Remote" to select the appropriate command.
   - Enter the URL of your GitHub repository when prompted and press Enter.
   - Alternatively, you can add a remote repository from the command line using the `git remote add` command.

2. Push Changes:
   - After staging and committing your changes, push them to your GitHub repository.
   - In the Source Control view, click on the ellipsis (...) icon and select "Push" from the dropdown menu.
   - Alternatively, you can push changes from the command line using the `git push` command.

3. Authenticate:
   - If prompted, authenticate with your GitHub credentials to push changes to the remote repository.

Additional Tips:

- Make sure to commit regularly and provide descriptive commit messages to track changes effectively.
- Pull changes from the remote repository (`git pull`) before pushing to avoid conflicts.
- Use branching (`git branch`) for managing different features or versions of your project.
